<p><strong>Step 1.</strong><strong> Files &amp; Poster Info:</strong> Provide the finished files to be printed and all of the answers to the <a href="Poster Request Info Form.docx">Poster Request Info Form</a> either by attaching the documents to an e-mail: <a href="mailto:NGLTechs@shsu.edu">NGLTechs@shsu.edu</a>, or copy and paste the text of the document into the body of the e-mail, or you can print and fill the form out to give to the technicians if you choose to physically drop off your poster.</p>
<p>You may provide your poster files to us digitally via email or bring them to our office on a flash drive. We do not accept hard copies to be scanned.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Quote &amp; Approval: </strong>Once we have received all necessary files and information, we will email a quote to the address that you provided. If you're paying with an interdepartmental, we will provide you with a pre-filled out interdepartmental as your quote. Please verify that the information on the quote is correct and let us know about any corrections that may be necessary or questions that you may have. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If there is anything wrong with the quote, it could delay the completion of your poster request as we will not start printing your posters until you approve the details.</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Printing:</strong> We will print poster requests as time permits.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Notification, Payment &amp; Pick-up. </strong>We will notify you via email when your posters are completed and ready to be picked up.</p>
<p>If you're paying with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cash, credit, or check</span>, bring a photo ID and the amount to be paid to the Copy Services department in room 103 of the library.<em> Please note: the Copy Services department cannot accept anything larger than a twenty dollar bill.</em></p>
<p>If you're paying with an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interdepartmental</span>, bring a photo ID and a signed original (can not be a copy) of the interdepartmental <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that we provided to you</span> as payment to the Copy Services department in room 103 of the library. DO NOT have a copy of the interdepartmental sent to us in any way. We only accept interdepartmentals by hand at the time that the posters are picked up.</p>
