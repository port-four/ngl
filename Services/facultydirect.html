<p>Faculty&gt;Direct is a service that offers delivery of articles and books that the Library holds to SHSU faculty members. This service is provided by the <a href="/about/departments/interlibrary/index.html">Interlibrary Services department</a> of the Newton Gresham Library.</p>
<p>Faculty&gt;Direct is available only to SHSU faculty members. This service was designed specifically to support the faculty teaching and research activities.</p>
<p>To use Faculty&gt;Direct, access your <a href="https://ezproxy.shsu.edu/login?url=http://oclc.shsu.edu/">ILLiad</a> account (the same account you use for Interlibrary Loan) and make sure your User Profileâ€™s delivery location is set to Faculty Direct*  before requesting the items you need. Articles and pages from books will be delivered electronically whenever possible; physical materials will be checked out to your account and delivered to your office.</p>
<p><em>*If your delivery location is set to campus box, home address, or ILL office, your faculty direct items will be sent to those locations for pick-up.</em></p>
<p>Normally, the materials will be delivered within two working days. (The status of your item will show as "Awaiting Distance Ed Request Processing" until it is processed and someone is available to deliver it.)</p>
<p>As noted, Faculty>Direct is designed to support and streamline your teaching and research activities, but materials are provided for the individual use of the requestor. If you wish to make a reading available for an entire class, please see our procedures for <a href="https://library.shsu.edu/services/faculty/#reserve"> placing materials on Reserve</a> instead, to ensure the necessary copyright considerations are taken for this use.</p>
