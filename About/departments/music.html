<h2>Finding Music Materials in the Online Catalog</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://unicorn.shsu.edu/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/0/0/49">online catalog</a> at SHSU offers several ways to search for music materials. If you are looking at broad topics, you may want to do a subject search. Some of the subject terms that you may search include:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 5%;">
<p>Music theory<br /> Music therapy<br /> Choral music<br /> Folk music<br /> Sacred music<br /> Popular music</p>
</div>
<p>Combining search terms using the "AND" operator, will allow you to search for items such as "sacred AND choral music."</p>
<p>When looking for recordings, you may search the catalog by title or author (composer). You can combine keywords to narrow your search. For example, if you want to find recordings of the Beethoven Violin Concerto you could combine the search terms "Beethoven" and "Concerto" as the keyword search "Beethoven AND Concerto." You may also limit your search by type of material by selecting "music recording" or "musical score."</p>
<p>If there are any questions, you can contact <a href="mailto:lib_bdh@shsu.edu">Bruce Hall</a> (the head of the department) at (936) 294-4800 or e-mail him at <a href="mailto:lib_bdh@shsu.edu">lib_bdh@shsu.edu</a>.</p>
